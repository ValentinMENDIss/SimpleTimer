# **SimpleTimer ðŸ•’ðŸ‡¨**
## **Simplistic CLI-Timer written in pure C**

---

## Important information:

**This program was created for fun :)**. If you do want to change something in source code, you can create pull requests/issues :).

## What it does?

This program is **CLI (inside Terminal) Simple and Light Timer that was written in C programming language.**
With it you can easily set up a timer inside of your terminal.

## Why was it created?

What inspired me to create this CLI-Tool? Well, actually I needed a timer for a small project that I was trying out.
**Right there I thought:** Why shouldn't I try to create my own timer for the terminal?

## How to install it?

To run this Program you need to 'cd' (navigate/go) into the directory of where the main.c file is located. And then run **'./main'**

To compile the program for yourself, type: **'gcc main.c -o main'** ( in the terminal inside of the code directory )
